[01:03] Somnath: Hi All, good morning
[01:04] Rishabh: Good morning Somnath
[01:04] Somnath: At least It is bit relaxed to work from home now a days as kids are at school. Last few days were really tough, had lot of new change requests coming on the project and no one is interested in shifting the delivery date.
[01:05] Milind: Yes, correct Somnath. I am working late nights since last week.
[01:06] Anupam: Hi, sorry for being late. Lets quickly start with meeting agenda of requirement for new changes. 
Do we have any bandwidth available or we need to ask for additional resource.
[01:08] Somnath: I just did high level estimation of changes and we two new change requests - one will take 2 days and seconds will take 4 days roughly
[01:10] Rutuja: We also need to consider testing effort as don't have any bandwidth of testing team available
[01:14] Anupam: So we will need 2 more resources for 1 week. Let me check with Kamal and come back on it.
By the way Rishabh, how is the development for requirement5 going, when we can get it done?
[01:18] Rishabh: Yess Anupam, [pause] we are just at last phase of development and i will build and submit the component by tomorrow.
[01:20] Anupam: Good. Milind, can you please setup a meeting for design walkthrough with the team.
[01:22] Milind: Sure Anupam, will set meeting for next week some time. We should be ready with Final design by the time.
[01:24] Somnath: Rutuja, are we done with data copy for our testing, we can use same data for unit testing as well.
[01:24] Rutuja: It is in progress, we have faced some space issues yesterday and now it is increased. So data should be copied by EOD today.
[01:27] Somnath: Thanks
[01:28] Milind: Anupam, Apart from this I am also working on couple of Prod issues which are eating lot of my time
[01:28] Anupam: Can we not assign them to anyone else in the team. We need to think about it for coming future. I always believed to have a dedicated team for Prod issues
[01:29] Rutuja: In my earlier project we used to have a team for production support and prod issues analysis was not responsibility for dev team
[01:30] Somnath: We don't have that much luxury here. But I at least expect some basic analysis to be done by prod support before coming to us. Even that is not happening.
[01:32] Anupam: Agree with you. Let me see if anything can be done on this. Anything else we want to discuss in this meeting? 
[01:33} Rishabh: Yes Anupam, I am on leave tomorrow and day after. I will finish the in progress task by today.
[01:33] Somnath: Please let me know if anything remains by the time you leave, we will take care.
[01:34] Anupam: Somnath, do we see any risk for current sprint?
[01:35] Somnath: No, we are good and situation is under control.
[01:35] Anupam: Good then, lets drop from the meeting. Thank you guys. Have a good day ahead.
