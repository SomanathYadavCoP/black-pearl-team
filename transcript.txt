[00:01] Steve: Welcome back, Brad. This is the second part of our interview, and I want to get through 
these as quickly as possible because I know you have somewhere to be.
[00:08] Brad: Thank you. It's my pleasure.
[00:09] Steve: It says on the website you worked doing graphic design for a local branding agency 
before branching out and starting your own business.
[00:18] Brad: Yes.
[00:19] Steve: Was that a conscious choice?
[00:21] Brad: Yes.
[00:24] Steve: Sorry, one sec. We can hear the fan.
[00:27] Charlene:
[inaudible 00:27]
[00:28] Steve: No, no, that's perfect. Thanks, Charlene. Good. 
Was starting your own company intentional, or did you just sort of fall into it?
[00:37] Brad: Actually, sort of both. I started out doing it as a favor for a friend. I didn't really know 
what I was doing at the time, but at some point I found out I was having some success 
with that, and so I started doing it for local businesses and restaurants.
Then it kind of took off from there, and then I figured, well, if I'm going to be taking on 
all these new clients I might as well get a website going and make something out of this, 
you know?
[01:07] Steve: Sure. What kind of challenges did you experience when you were starting out, that you 
weren't expecting?
[01:13] Brad: Hmm, challenges I wasn't expecting.
[01:17] Steve: [laughs] I keep putting you on the spot. I don't think I put that one in the questions 
either. We're just ad-libbing here.
[01:24] Brad: No, it's fine. So, challenges ...
[01:27] Steve: Yeah. It could be funding or anything. I forgot to ask you earlier, did you bootstrap?

[01:33] Brad: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I had literally, like, $200 in the bank when I started out. And that's 
Canadian dollars, so that's like, what, two cents US? [laughs] Nah, just kidding. Pretty 
sad though.
[01:46] Steve: Oh, really?
[01:48] Brad: Yeah. Well, and an AdWords credit, maybe $50 or $100 or something like that, but I had 
no idea what I was doing at the time.
[01:58] Steve: Right. How did you get the word out about your business and what you were doing?
[02:05] Brad: Uh ... phew. Well, besides the referrals I was getting, I enlisted my first few clients by 
this post on Facebook and asking my friend ... My one friend, he's got, like, 8,000 
Facebook friends and I have, like, two, and one of them's my mom.
[02:20] Steve: [laughing]
[02:21] Brad: No, serious, Steve. So, I asked this buddy to help me out and put this thing up for me, 
and he has a lot of friends who do that kind of thing, so I got a few leads out of the deal 
that I still do work for sometimes, and one of them is my biggest client, so yeah.
[02:39] Steve: Nice.
[02:40] Brad: Yeah. Then the other thing I did was local outreach with local magazines and 
newspapers and whatnot, and I got a couple of mentions that way that led to my first 
"real" clients. Not that they weren't real before, but sometimes when they're your 
friends it kind of feels like they're doing a favor, you know?
I did have some luck also with networking and meetup groups and stuff like that – you 
know, local – but I'm a bit of an introvert, so it took me a while to get around to it. 
[laughs]
[03:11] Steve: No way. I don't believe it. Do you have a Twitter?
[03:16] Brad: Yeah, I have a Twitter. [laughs] "A Twitter." But I don't think I've ever posted a tweet. I 
can't even remember my password. I'm too old for that stuff, Steve. I'm pushing 50 next 
month.
[03:27] Steve: [laughs]
[03:29] Brad: Well, Steve, you know what they say. Nothing beats good old-fashioned PR for a local 
business. I don't know who "they" are.
